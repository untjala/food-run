# Food Run

<!-- TODO: clean up description, add visuals, credits, etc -->

Group: Charles Young, Marquise Allen, Connor Thompson, Patrick Long, Jala Unterreiner
Summary: Our aim is to create a runner-style platform game, Food Run, in which the player can jump and crouch to dodge obstacles and eat foods that will either increase or decrease speed.
The player will login/create an account at the start of the game, and their score will be saved and persist upon relaunching the game. The application will be deployed on Heroku.
This game will be created using JS, Node.js, HTML/HTML canvas, and CSS.
